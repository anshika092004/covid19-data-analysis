 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This end-to-end project explores the impact of COVID-19 at both global and Indian levels using data cleaning (Python), SQL querying, and interactive dashboards built in Power BI.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally and across Indian states, with the goal of deriving meaningful insights around case trends, vaccination progress, and demographic distributions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and merge raw COVID-19 datasets
- Perform SQL-based querying for data exploration
- Visualize critical metrics using two separate Power BI dashboards:
  - 🌍 Global COVID-19 Analysis
  - 🇮🇳 India COVID-19 Analysis
- Draw insights to support policy, public health, and data-driven decisions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Power BI** (DAX, data modeling, visual design)

---

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

### 🌍 Global COVID-19 Dashboard

**Key Features**:
- Vaccination vs. New COVID-19 Cases Over Time (Line Chart)
- Total Cases by Country (Bar Chart)
- Distribution by Income Group (Donut Chart)
- Geographic Distribution (Map)
- Vaccination Share by Country (Pie Chart)

📌 **Insights**:
- High-income countries showed early vaccination progress
- Total cases concentrated in a few countries (e.g., USA, India)
- Line chart revealed second and third waves in different regions

- State-wise Active Cases (Map)
- Dose Count by Age Category (Pie Chart)
- Gender-wise Dosage (Donut Chart)
- Daily Trends: Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths (Line Chart)

📌 **Insights**:
- Highest vaccination in 2021
- States like Maharashtra and Kerala had higher case numbers
- Younger population (18–45) had the most vaccinations
